# bccPythonDeveloperTutorial

My solutions and notes for the lessons provided in the bcc Python Developer Tutorial. 

https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/docs/tutorial_bcc_python_developer.md

Most of the lessons are completed except for Lesson 13 (disksnoop.py fixed), as I encountered issues with populating the T field which mostly deals with identifying if it's a disk read or write.
